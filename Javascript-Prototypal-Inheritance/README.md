#This SelfEd about Prototypal Inheritance is only a comment right now 

I'm developing a SelfEd about passing parameters between states and when reveiwing the data object for $state configurations in the [**ui-router API**](https://ui-router.github.io/ng1/docs/0.3.1/index.html#/api/ui.router.state.$stateProvider) there's a mention of prototypal inheritance.

I found a nice explanation by [**Kevin Ennis who explains Protypal Inheritance**](https://medium.com/@kevincennis/prototypal-inheritance-781bccc97edb#.j1o7eenl4) and decided this is a worthy topic for a SelfEd.

I am fondly reminded of the work I've done in JAVA defining and buiding classes.

Some places I looked at while working this:
