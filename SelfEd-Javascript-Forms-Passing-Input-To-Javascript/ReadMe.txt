SelfEd Title:           SelfEd-Javascript-Forms-Passing-Input-To-Javascript
 
SelfEd Objective:       To pass input from HTML directly to Javascript

SelfEd Catalyst:        Been working on:
                        < SelfEd-Angular-Directives-Custom-With-Link-Keyword >
                        when I needed to confirm my approach to changing the
                        data in a data object array. I simply wanted to enter
                        a number and send it directly to Javascript. So I did
                        a little side project and realized there's a trick
                        to it. Enough of a trick to warrant a SelfEd.

Process:
    I had to probe around a bit but found:
    < http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7716848/how-to-pass-a-form-input-value-into-a-javascript-function >
    which has numerous ways to do it.
    See file: < passingInputToJS.html > for the example I started with. There
    is certainly more to add to this SelfEd.
