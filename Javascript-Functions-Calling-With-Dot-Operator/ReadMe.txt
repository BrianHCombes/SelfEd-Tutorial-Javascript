SelfEd Title:           
                        Sub Title: Dot-Operator-Calling-Of-Functions

SelfEd Objective:       Learning additional nuances of ways to call functions

SelfEd Catalyst:        While working on:
                        < SelfEd-Angular-Practice-ProjectA-HTTP-Service >
                        and trying to fully understand placing a RESTful
                        service into an Angular factory service I did some
                        experimenting with calling functions.

Process:
    I wanted to know where regular Javascript ends and AngularJS begins.
    I suspected using the dot operator: see the part in the code that has
    < subPrimeFunc().response2(); > in it is part of regular Javascript.
    Look at the code to see how function(s) response1 and response2 are called
    with the dor=t operator.
    This syntax is part of regular Javascript but is strikingly similar to 
    the syntax in AngularJS factory service methods. I encountered this
    understanding while working on:
                        < SelfEd-Angular-Practice-ProjectA-HTTP-Service >
