SelfEd Title:           SelfEd-Javascript-Functions-Passing-Of

SelfEd Objective:       To familiarize with the passing functions in various
                        forms.

SelfEd Catalyst:        While working with the MEAN stack I encountered a
                        situation requiring me to better understand passing 
                        functions as arguments of functions.
