SelfEd Title:           SelfEd-Javascript-Passing-URL-Parameters

SelfEd Objective:       To pass parameters on a url string in as any ways as
                        possible.

SelfEd Catalyst:        Was working on the website for selling the grow gear
                        and needed to pass parameters from one page to another.

Process:

Not much to show yet but the two html files are a working start and enough to
keep my grow gear sale project moving along.

I wrote and completed a website to sell the grow gear. I actually pass 
parameters on the URL. The main page has a menu. When a button is clicked
I attach which button is clicked to the url of the page that gets called.
Start with the < index.html > file and the < mainmenu.js > files to see the
parameter passing to files < GFS-Image-Page.html > and < GFS-Image-Page.js >
to see all the details.
