SelfEd Title:           SelfEd-Javascript-Passing-URL-Parameters

SelfEd Objective:       To pass parameters on a url string in as any ways as
                        possible.

SelfEd Catalyst:        Was working on the website for selling the grow gear
                        and needed to pass parameters from one page to another.

Process:

Not much to show yet but the two html files are a working start and enough to
keep my grow gear sale project moving along.
