:red_circle:**03/29/2017 - Major incorporation of parameter passing in a project:** I wrote and completed a website to sell a client's grow gear. The project is called: **Project-TTD-Grow-Gear-Sale.** I actually pass parameters on the URL. The main page has a menu. When a button is clicked I attach which button is clicked to the url of the page that gets called. Start with the **< index.html >** file and the **< mainmenu.js >** files to see the parameter passing to files **< GFS-Image-Page.html >** and **< GFS-Image-Page.js >** to see all the details.
